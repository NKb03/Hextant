# Hextant - An AST-Editor
**Hextant is in a very early stage of development. So there is no "real" version**.  
If you want to try an example to grasp the key concepts of Hextant,
please refer to [this](https://github.com/NKb03/Hextant/wiki/The-calculator-example) wiki page.  
Generally the [wiki](https://github.com/NKb03/Hextant/wiki) is the best source for information.
